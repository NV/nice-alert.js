Quote from Jef Raskin
---------------------
The information-theoretic efficiency *E* of an interface is defined as the minimum amount of information necessary to do
a task, divided by the amount of information that has to be supplied by the user. As is true of physical efficiency, *E*
is at least 0 and is at most 1. Where no work is required for a task and no work is done, the efficiency is defined as 1.

*E* can be 0 when the user is required to provide information that is totally unnecessary. Surprisingly, a number of
interface details achieve the dubious honor of having *E*=0. A dialog box that allows the user only one possible action,
such as clicking the box’s OK button, is such an example. (JavaScript has a command, *Alert*, solely for creating such
unnecessary boxes: The designers were wise enough to remove goto from the JavaScript language to force structured code,
but they failed to provide similar guidance on the interface side.)
